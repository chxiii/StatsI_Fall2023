		\item Please show your work! You may lose points by simply writing in the answer. If the problem requires you to execute commands in \texttt{R}, please include the code you used to get your answers. Please also include the \texttt{.R} file that contains your code. If you are not sure if work needs to be shown for a particular problem, please ask.
	\item Your homework should be submitted electronically on GitHub.
	\item This problem set is due before 23:59 on Sunday November 19, 2023. No late assignments will be accepted.

\noindent In this problem set, you will run several regressions and create an add variable plot (see the lecture slides) in \texttt{R} using the \texttt{incumbents\_subset.csv} dataset. Include all of your code.

				If two regression model's residuals is the same, we can conclude that:
		
		\item[$\bullet$] The homoskedasticity assumption is met: the residual variances of the two models are similar at different levels of the explanatory variables.
		\item[$\bullet$]The model fits the data well: The presence of homoscedasticity may indicate that the model fits the data well because it meets the basic assumptions of linear regression.
		\item[$\bullet$]Reliability of model comparisons and interpretations: Model comparisons and interpretation of model results can be made more reliably if the residuals of two models are the same.
